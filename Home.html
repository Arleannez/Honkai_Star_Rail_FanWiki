            <h1 id="about">Honkai Star Rail</h1>
            <p><b>Honkai: Star Rail</b> is a role-playing gacha video game
                developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China and
                worldwide by Cognosphere, d/b/a HoYoverse. It features the main
                character (referred to as the "Trailblazer" in English but with
                different names in other languages) traveling across worlds
                resolving disasters caused by the "Stellaron". The first closed
                beta test was launched on October 27, 2021. It was publicly
                released internationally on April 26, 2023, for Windows and
                mobile devices; with the PlayStation 5 port released on October
                11, 2023. The PlayStation 4 version is still yet to be
                announced, as revealed at the latest Summer Game Fest with a
                trailer.<br><br> It is the fourth installment in the Honkai
                series, drawing on characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and
                gameplay elements from Genshin Impact (although with significant
                adjustments to the characters' background and personality and
                changes to the gameplay elements). It is miHoYo's first
                turn-based game.</p>
            <br>

            <h1 id="game">Gameplay</h1>
            <p>Honkai: Star Rail follows the gameplay style of classic Japanese
                role-playing games: players build up a lineup of characters, and
                control a team of four in turn-based combat.<br><br>In addition
                to various stats that affect characters' strength, each
                character has an elemental affinity that affects their ability
                to deal damage to certain targets, a character class referred to
                as a "path" that defines their role in combat, and set of unique
                abilities used in combat.<br><br>Elements of open-world and
                dungeon exploration are present, with multiple mechanics,
                including the gacha system, carried over from HoYoverse's
                previous action RPG Genshin Impact.</p>

            <h1 id="story">Story and Setting</h1>
            <p>The game is set in a science-fantasy universe in which humanity
                and non-human sentient beings follow the Paths of deity-like
                beings known as Aeons. Those who follow Paths are known as
                Pathstriders.
                <br><br>T
                he Paths are based on an ideal. For example, the Abundance is
                based on the view that immortality is a blessing and that
                healing and altruism should be valued as a top priority.<br><br>
                The Destruction believes that civilization is cancerous to the
                universe, and seeks to eradicate all of civilization through the
                spreading of various disasters, such as the Stellaron, also
                known as the Cancer of All Worlds, which brings destruction to
                any planet it is placed on.
                <br><br>
                The Path of Remembrance, run by the Aeon Fuli, is associated
                with ice, and has an obsession with time. Some Paths were led by
                deceased Aeons, but the Paths continue to exist without the
                influence of the Aeons. The main characters in the game follow
                the Path of the Trailblaze, a Path created by the deceased
                Akivili.
                <br><br>
                The Path of the Trailblaze seeks to
                "explore, establish, and connect" among different worlds.
                Some Paths are seen as antagonistic, protagonistic, or neutral.
                The primary antagonist of the game is Nanook, who controls the
                Path of Destruction, along with the followers of the Path of
                Destruction. Other paths, such as the Path of Abundance, are not
                necessarily seen as antagonistic, but are at rival with The Hunt
                and other Paths, who view the immortality granted by the Path of
                Abundance as a curse.
                Aside from the Path of Destruction, the Stellaron Hunters are a
                major antagonistic group throughout the game, who search for and
                collect Stellarons across the universe, and claim to be able to
                see the future. The main characters are often at conflict with
                the Stellaron Hunters.</p>
